This file contains the data analysis of microarray datasets. These datasets can be downloaded from the GEO database. 
There are multiple ways to generate transcriptomic data: from CEL files (by performing RMA normalization), directly from the GEO database, or manually from the GEO web page.
Additionally, the code performs DEG analysis using limma, visualizes results with a volcano plot, and conducts enrichment analysis with g:Profiler.
